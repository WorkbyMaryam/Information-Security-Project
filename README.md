**Title:** Phishing Attack Detection Using AI

**Description:**  
This repository contains the research project "Phishing Attack Detection Using AI," conducted by Anna Rai, Wajiha Naveed, and Maryam Nasir at FAST-NU, Lahore, Pakistan. The project explores advanced methods to detect and prevent phishing attacks using Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques.  

**Abstract:**  
Phishing is one of the most persistent cybersecurity threats, exploiting trust and leveraging social engineering tactics to steal sensitive information. Traditional security measures often struggle to combat the rapid evolution of phishing strategies. This project investigates the role of AI—encompassing machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and deep learning—in phishing detection. By analyzing patterns, anomalies, and threats in real-time, AI demonstrates high accuracy and adaptability in addressing phishing attempts.  

**Features:**  
- **AI Techniques Explored:**  
   - Supervised Learning  
   - Natural Language Processing  
   - Deep Learning (CNNs, RNNs)  
- **Application Domains:**  
   - Email filtering  
   - URL analysis  
   - Personalized cybersecurity training  

**Key Insights:**  
- Importance of dataset quality and diversity in model robustness.  
- Use of real-time adaptive mechanisms for zero-day phishing detection.  
- Challenges include evasion tactics, ethical considerations, and privacy concerns.  

**Future Directions:**  
1. Enhancing AI algorithms with reinforcement learning.  
2. Integrating hybrid systems combining AI with human expertise.  
3. Developing privacy-preserving mechanisms for sensitive data processing.  
4. Creating collaborative AI ecosystems for multi-layered defenses.
